## Retirement Planning
Using the Monte Carlo model, we were able to simulate 500 predictions of what our client's cumulative retirement portfolio returns could be over the next 30 years.
Our portfolio consists of 1 stock - AGG (60%) and 1 bond - SPY (40%) from the Alpaca API.

We are able to say with a certainty of 90% that cumulative returns would range between $98.59 and $376.52 over the next 30 years.

At our client's request, we did another analysis with a 5 year timeline and a higher investment of $40,000. We came up with the following analysis:

Unfortunately, 5 years is simply too short a time to amass that amount of wealth for that many years of retirement. Even with a 80:20 stock-bond portfolio and an initial investment that is more than double, the client would not be able to save enough to retire.
Investing completely in stocks would be too risky and is therefore, not advisable.
